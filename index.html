            <h2>Important Reminders</h2>
            <dl>
                <dt>Why am I collecting?</dt>
                <dd>You are in this for the love of the music, not to make money. It is exciting to find a great sounding albums at crazy good prices.</dd>
                <dt>Why can't I make money doing this if I'm getting things so cheaply?</dt>
                <dd>You don't have time to resell records. If you are going to sell the entire collection some day, that's fine, but you'll need to send it as a single lot. It takes too much time and effort to list albums individually on CL or Ebay.</dd>
                <dt>Don't spend more than $10 on an album, no matter how much you want it.</dt>
                <dd>If it costs more than that, it's not worth it. Record store dealers list records at stupid prices for things that aren't in perfect shape, all because they think that record collectors are collecting records for resale eventually, and not for music enjoyment now.</dd>
                <dt>What should I be spending on classical albums?</dt>
                <dd>You got back into record collecting in particular because you inherited Dad's collection. Then you started finding clasical albums you didn't already have in some format on LP at $.50 and $1.00 (actually 25% off that). The most you've spent on one LP so far is $5. Don't spend much more than that for a single album. If the prices are higher than that check Tidal, Freegal, Spotify, Hoopla, YouTube - in that order. </dd>
                <dt>But I think I can make money on this album</dt>
                <dd>If you are thinking that, then it's because you already have it on LP, SACD, or CD. Stop it. The only time you will ever make money selling records is if you fall into a super amazing deal you can't pass up and you already have a buyer for the entire lot. Consider how much moeny and effort it will take in boxing, moving, storing, and selling. Again, you will not sell records individually.</dd>
                <dt>But I really think I can make money on this album</dt>
                <dd>Garage sale, maybe, and only if you bought them at less than $.25 each. There is no way you will sell all the albums at a weekend garage sale. You might not sell any. You have already sold items before and didn't make money on them. Remember those times.</dd>

                <h2>RCA Living Stereo (and RCA Victor)!</h2>
                
                These recordings are really what got you excited about collecting SACDs, then Living Stereo on CD, and then jumping into LPs again because so many were never released on CD. The golden age of early stereo recorded on tube equipment was from about 1958 to 1965. They went from two channel stereo to three channel early on, and then mixed-down the three-channel to two. Many of your SACDs are three-channel. Living Stereo shaded dogs are highly collectable, and fetch ridiculous prices, usually a couple hundred dollars for not even mint condition. Most collectors look for the 1S stamp on the dead wax on both sides, but unfortunately, you can't go by the low stamper numbers of 1S or 2S because the 1st and 2nd pressings might not be the best. There is so much variance, even between different sides on the same album, that it's not worth it to spend the money. There were three pressing plants and people even buy just those from a specific plant, with a specific technician that was stamping that day. They're way out of your price-range. But, you might get lucky like you have before. You own all the RCA Living Stereo SACDs that Sony released in the 2000s (50). Their sound quality is superb, better than any of the shaded dogs you've stumbled upon and could afford. You also own a few SACD that Analogue Productions have redone recently. You have several shaded dog mono LPs (RCA Victor in upper right of album cover - no Living Stereo logo at top, but exact same cover pictures and descriptions) that sound great and were released simultaneously with the first run of Living Stereo albums. The white dog on black background albums came after the shaded dogs. They also sound great. You have several. The white dog on red (no shading) are reissues and sound ok. After this, RCA Living Stereo were released on Red Seal label and/or with Dynagroove technology, which was basically high compression (less dynamic range). These sound ok on crappy systems, but sound really bad on your system. Only buy these if the album was only released in Dynagroove, like your Death of the Bishop album. You sold all of your Dynagroove because they truly sound horrible. Stereo releases start with LS. Mono start with LM or LO.

                 <h2>Mercury Living Presence!</h2>
            
                The Mercury Living Presence albums come in mono and stereo (as opposed to RCA's Living Stereo which, duh). The monos sound fantastic as do the stereos. They experimented with three-channel recording like RCA Living Stereo. Top quality recordings. You only own one stereo on LP that you got from Dad's collection, but you own the three 50 CD box sets which are fantastic. If you can pick up any Living Presence Stereos for cheap, go for it. There were 20 of these released on SACD and the sound quality is up there. Unfortunately, they're between $20 and $50. But, if you can find them for less, definitely pick them up because they sound better than the CDs.

                    Deutsche Grammophon has excellent quality recordings throughout their run into the early '80s when everyone started recording digitally. The best sounding you've found so far have the round tulip border, Stereo written in the banner, centered below the entire writing of DGG. The later good recordings don't have Gesellschaft on them at all. Early records = mono is LPM. Stereo is SLPM. You have several of both. Try for early stereo, but you can't go wrong - great performances and sound quality into digital era. You have Karajan conducting Beethoven's 9 Symphonies on Blu Ray audio. You also have Karajan's complete Richard Strauss box set on CD and Blu Ray audio. It doesn't get better than these, so no need to buy vinyl of them. Karajan's Pines and Fountains of Rome on Esoteric remaster label from Japan you have is a thing of beauty.

                    Columbia Masterworks are hidden treasures. These are easy to come by for cheap, they sound amazing, and have great performances and great conductors - early Bernstein and Eugene Ormandy in particular. You're only looking for two things, the first being the Columbia Six Eyes, which have the six microphones - three on left and three on right of spindle hole. Stereo Fidelity written at top. You have a few monos - they don't sound half as good, but are still decent. Slightly newer stereo Six Eyes have CBS in the banner between Stereo and Fidelity, but you don't have any - yet. After that came the Two Eyes, which you have a few. Six eyes and two eyes both sound great. After that, sound quality decreases. Once they went to the brownish lable with orange lettering around the outside, the quality went downhill. You've had a few and sold all of them.

                    <h2>Everest Records!</h2>
                
                    From 1958 to 1962ish Everest made some great recordings. Copland, Stokowski, etc. conducting amazing works. The mono recordings are super good as well, but get stereo where you can. There have been some reissues and re-releases, but not from Everest Records. Analogue Productions just released a few, and they're $40 a piece. Apparently they sound better than the originals, but the originals you have are fantastic (some people say they suck - whatever), and you got them at great prices. You don't have any on CD or SACD, but there are some out there from reissue labels - if you see any, they have been reviewed very well. Many of the titles are available on Tidal, so when you need your Everest fix, you can go there.

                    <h2>Decca/London!</h2>
                
                    Everyone goes for the early Decca wideband labels, and then snatch-up the narrowband. Decca had some of the best recording gear in the business. BUT, the wide vs. narrow band labels is just for sellers to make money. London was Decca's U.S. subsidiary, and used the exact same presses to make the records. As long as you get London records that were made in England, you're golden. In fact, the London's into the '70s with FFRR (Full Frequency Range Recordings - FFRR) are fantastic, and again, can be found easily and cheaply because everyone is grabbing up the widebands that don't even sound as good (but still sound great). The earlier Full Frequency Stereophonic Sound [FFSS] predated FFRR. You don't have any Deccas - good luck! But, you have some London's on vinyl and love them. You also have some on CD that are pretty decent.

                        <h3>Other labels to consider and those you can leave alone</h3>
                    <p>
                        Philips, EMI, and His Master's Voice are well known and many record lovers like their sound. HMV is strictly British, and because their sound quality is good, are picked up quickly. You haven't seen any of these, so if you do and the price is below $5, try one out. There are many labels that aren't any good, for sure stay away from Angel and Seraphim. You've had a few from various eras and they don't sound good at all. Also, stay away from standard repertoire recorded on the Nonesuch label. The performances are mediocre and the sound quality is lacking. BUT, they did release some modern, mid-20th centery pieces that weren't recorded elsewhere. You have George Crumb's Ancient Voices of Children, and it's really good. You can add more to this space later, but since you sold off your initial record collection years ago, and just weeded your more recent collection, you don't have any crap left and hopefully you know enough about what you like that you don't have to spend much to find good recordings. If you are very, very lucky when you're out shopping, you'll run into some of these excellent re-issue labels that license classical recordings: Mobile Fidelity Sound Labs, Analogue Productions, Esoteric, Classic Records (bought-out by Ana Pro), Reference Recordings - their SACDs are phoenomenal, and you never see them used.
