            <h2>Most important things to remember</h2>
            <dl>
                <dt>Why am I collecting?</dt>
                <dd>You are in this for the love of the music, not to make money. It is exciting to find a great sounding album at crazy good prices.</dd>
                <dt>Why can't I make money doing this if I'm getting things so cheaply?</dt>
                <dd>You don't have time to resell records. If you are going to sell the entire collection some day, that's fine, but you'll need to send it as a single lot. It takes too much time and effort to list albums individually on CL or Ebay.</dd>
                <dt>Don't spend more than $10 on an album, no matter how much you want it.</dt>
                <dd>If it costs more than that, it's not worth it. Record store dealers list records at crazy prices for things that aren't in perfect shape, all because they think that record collectors are collecting records for resale eventually, and not for music enjoyment now.</dd>
                <dt>What should I be spending on classical albums?</dt>
                <dd>You got back into record collecting in particular because you inherited Dad's collection. Then you started finding clasical albums you didn't already have on LP at $.50 and $1.00 (actually 25% off that). The most you've spent on one LP so far is $5. Don't spend much more than that for a single album. If the prices are higher than that check Tidal, Freegal, Spotify, Hoopla, YouTube - in that order. </dd>
                <dt>But I think I can make money on this album</dt>
                <dd>If you are thinking that, then it's because you already have it on LP, SACD, or CD. Stop it. The only time you will ever make money selling records is if you fall into a super amazing deal you can't pass up and you already have a buyer for the entire lot. Consider how much moeny and effort it will take in boxing, moving, storing, and selling. Again, you will not sell records individually.</dd>
                <dt>But I really think I can make money on this album</dt>
                <dd>Garage sale, maybe, and only if you bought them at less than $.25 each. There is no way you will sell all the albums at a weekend garage sale. You might not sell any. You have already sold items before and didn't make money on them. Remember those times.</dd>

                <h2>RCA Living Stereo!</h2>
            <p> 
                The Living Stereo shaded dogs in the red label sound the best. These are also the most expensive, and can fetch prices upwards of a couple hundred dollars. They're way out of your price-range. But, you might get lucky like you have before. You own all the RCA Living Stereo SACDs that Sony released in the 2000s. You also own a few that Analogue Productions have released the last few years. You have several shaded dog mono LPs that sound great and were released simultaneously with the first run of Living Stereo albums. The white dog on black background came after. They also sound great. You have several. The white dog on red (no shading) came after and are reissues. They sound ok. After this, RCA Living Stereo were released with Dynagroove technology, which was basically high compression (less dynamic range). These sound better on crappy systems, but sound really bad on your system - WARNING - only buy these if the album was only released in Dynagroove, like your Death of the Bishop album.

                 <h2>Mercury Living Presence!</h2>
            <p>
                The Mercury Living Presence albums come in mono and stereo (as opposed to RCA's Living Stereo which, duh). The monos sound fantastic as do the stereos. You don't own any stereos on LP, but you own the three CD box sets which are fantastic. If you can pick up any Living Presence Stereos for cheap, go for it.
