## Purpose of Project

I plan on using this site to be able to access my growing music collection from wherever I am, show where I've purchased records and CDs and more importantly, to inform me what I should/should not be purchasing. I don't want to spend too much money on records that don't sound good! There are a few labels I'm looking for, and certain eras from those labels.
